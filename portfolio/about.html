			<h3>What's with the name?</h3>
			<p>In 2018, a whole bunch of things came into my life that happened to be cool... and grey.  My wife and I bought a house in the quaint little town of Newmarket NH, and it is a weathered grey cedar shake house.<br><br> Shortly before that we got a small cat and he developed the nickname 'Don Gato', he was also grey.<br><br>When we moved into our house, there is a semi-finished garage and I wanted to turn it into a pseudo pub/hangout room.  Searching for a cool old-school british-ey name... The Grey Gato was born.</p>
			<h3>What are you doing here?</h3>
			<p>Here I sit, in the throes of my 1/3<sub>rd</sub> life crisis, making moves and figuring out what I want to do when I grow up. <br><br>
			<strong>Grey Gato Media is a Full-Stack web development enclave nestled in an old house on an old street in an old town.  Run by an almost-middle-aged man.</strong></p>
